Positive indicates detected presence while negative indicates OCBs were not detected.\nConclusion: Patients with a presence of OCBs have about 84.5% lower odds to be diagnosed with MS, although that could be as low as 80% or as high as 89%.\nModel: Although the data included multiple variables such as age, gender, years of schooling, and past Varicella infections, I chose to model Oligoclonal Bands, with only values of “positive” and “negative”, as a logistic function of whether or not a patient was diagnosed with MS. Patients with a positive presence were less likely to be diagnosed with MS than those with a negative presence."
