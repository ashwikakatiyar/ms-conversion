# Conversion of Clinically Isolated Syndrome to Multiple Sclerosis

Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a devastating, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that affects people of all ages and genders, and Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS) is a patient's first episode of neurological symptoms, which may then develop into MS. This project explores potential predictors of the development of Multiple Sclerosis.
